SOLID is a set of 5 design principles in software engineering intended to make software development more flexible, easier to maintain, and easier to understand.

Advantages:

•	Improved maintainability

•	Reduced complexity

•	Enhanced flexibility

•	Increased scalability

The 5 principles of SOLID are:

##	S: Single-responsibility principle

A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software’s specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
A class should have only one reason to change.

##	O: Open-Closed principle

Software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## L: Liskov substitution principle

Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program. 

## I: Interface segregation principle

Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

## D: Dependency inversion principle

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions (interfaces)
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (like concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.
